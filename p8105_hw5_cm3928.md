# Problem 1

This is the code chunk that introduces missing data in the **iris**
dataset.

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species)) %>% view()
```

## Writing the Function

I will then create a function that will replace missing numeric values
by the mean of that particular variable and also this function will
replace missing character values with the the species **virginica**.

``` r
missingness = function(x) {
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    replace(x, is.na(x), "virginica")
  } else if (is.numeric(x)) {
  replace(x, is.na(x), mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
  }
}
```

``` r
iris1 = 
  map_df(.x = iris_with_missing, ~ missingness(.x)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
iris1 %>% head()
```

    ## [1] " Sepal.Length   Sepal.Width   Petal.Length   Petal.Width  Species    "
    ## [2] "-------------  ------------  -------------  ------------  -----------"
    ## [3] "     5.100000      3.500000       1.400000      0.200000  setosa     "
    ## [4] "     4.900000      3.000000       1.400000      0.200000  setosa     "
    ## [5] "     4.700000      3.200000       1.300000      0.200000  setosa     "
    ## [6] "     4.600000      3.100000       1.500000      1.192308  setosa     "

# Problem 2

Reading in data and tidying it.

``` r
data_path = "data/" 
files = dir(data_path, pattern = "*.csv") 

data = data_frame(filename = files) %>% 
  mutate(file_contents = map(filename, ~ read_csv(file.path(data_path, .))))  
```
